The Baltic startup Digipulse has launched the world’s first digital asset vault that ensures safe, encrypted and decentralised storage and transfer of crypto wallets and other digital assets.

The vault with no third party involvement can be used to store any type of files – documents, images, passwords, crypto wallet keys. All the information will automatically be transferred to the recipients of a user’s choice, using online activity as a trigger. The user can proactively choose which digital assets to upload to the decentralized vault, as well as when and to whom the assets will be transferred to once the user activity drop is confirmed.

The startup raised $1,000,000 with a successful Token Sale in the autumn of 2017.

“In an increasingly digitised world, the global inheritance framework has been struggling to provide a modern solution to the growing issues of digital asset inheritance. In the absence of sustainable technology, even a testament will not ensure that a person’s assets are passed on to their rightful recipients. Digipulse aims to disrupt the stagnant industry with a management tool that enables all digital and crypto asset holders to have ultimate control over who will receive their digital assets. No third parties or middlemen involved,” Digipulse CEO Normunds Kvilis told.

“We see an increasing trend amongst tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Twitter towards developing tools for managing their inactive accounts. However, each service can only operate within their own platforms. Digipulse’s B2B ‘Pulse Network’ aims to provide a unified service for enterprises and user bases of all sizes,” Digipulse’s Head of Business Development Jānis Zaltāns noted.

The idea to launch Digipulse came when the startup’s co-founder and CTO Dmitry Dedelis after encountering health issues realized that if he were to pass away, his family would never be able to access his digital assets, including his crypto savings.
