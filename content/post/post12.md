Investment banking firm Benson Oak, headquartered in Prague, is launching an investment fund for the Israeli market, focused on blockchain and consumer-facing companies.

According to CTech, the new fund has already raised $25 million with the intention of raising a total of $100 million by the end of 2018.

Benson Oak Ventures is planning to target seed-stage companies and is expected to announce two portfolio companies in nearest future.

“I believe that there are great entrepreneurs in Israel who are leading the platforms of the future, with creating and disruptive use of blockchain technologies. I moved to Israel six years ago, and with a passion to build companies, I have established Benson Oak Ventures as a new platform to provide financial and operational capital to the best entrepreneurs in Israel and around the world,” firm’s managing partner Robert Cohen said, according to Jerusalem Post.

Let us remind that Benson Oak’s capital comes from private investors, strategic companies, and family offices, and the firm does not partner with institutional investors.

Benson Oak has previously established three funds that invested in high-tech in the United States, the Czech Republic and Israel.
